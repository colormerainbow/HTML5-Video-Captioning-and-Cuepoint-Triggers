00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
- A lot of people are worried about synergies, but I can tell you that

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
- statistics show

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
- there is no danger of increased cancer risk from synergies.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
- However, it's better to be safe than sorry.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
-  I'm going to demonstrate how you how we can leverage a synergy.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
- First of all, I've got this banana

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
- This banana represents "Web 2.0" and look,

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
- I've written on it some "user-generated content"

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
- just to prove the point [You Suck, WTF, LOL]

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
- I take my "Web 2.0" and I put it in an envelope

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
- marked "paradigm shift".

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
- OK. Very important, I put the envelope down and

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
- With a bit of "blue sky thinking"

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
- I "push the envelope"

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
- Then, I take my leverage mallet, and

16
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.000
- URGH!

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
- RGRRRRRARGRGGH!!

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.500
- ...and there we can see a synergy, leveraged.
